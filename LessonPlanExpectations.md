#Lesson Plan Components

**Objective:** What will students be able to do by the time they leave class each day?

**Instructional Plan:** How are you going to accomplish your objective?

**Assessment:** How can you prove to yourself and your students that they accomplished the objective?

**Homework:** Students have 10 hours of activities to complete each week on their own time.

###Recommendations

*Name files something that will help students search and locate their notes/exercises

*Use a textbook or some sort of standard reference material.

*Use a lesson plan model to organize your lesson
