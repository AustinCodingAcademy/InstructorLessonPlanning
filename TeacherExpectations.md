#Austin Coding Academy Teacher Expectations 

**All ACA teachers should:**
* Begin class and end class on time  (6:30 – 9:00).
* Teachers should over plan, so there is never unused class time or “early release”.
  
**All lesson plans should contain the following:**
* Daily objective
  * What do you want students to be able to do by the end of the class?
* Instructional plan
  * How will you teach students the objective?
  * Include real world application of concept to demonstrate relevance.
* Assessment of objective
  * How do you know students can do the objective?
* 10 hours of homework per week (1 hour on Mon/Tues, 9 hours on Wed/Thur)
  * Projects, problems, games, etc.
  * You can have students research concepts, watch videos, readings, etc.
  * Anything that makes students think, challenges them

**Further lesson plan expectations:**
  
* A unit plan is required by September 7th.
  * The unit plan must address all course objectives.
  * Students will leave your class proficient in all objectives.
  * See the (SampleUnitPlan)[https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/InstructorLessonPlanning/blob/master/UnitPlanSample]
* A midterm and final exam will ensure all students met objectives. 
* The first 2 weeks of lesson plans are due by September 7th.
* All future lesson plans must be turned in at least one week in advance.
* “Turning in lesson plans” means uploading them to github @ https://github.com/orgs/AustinCodingAcademy/


**We are in the curriculum develpoment phase. More work now means less work later.**
