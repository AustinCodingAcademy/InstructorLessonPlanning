ACA Problem Solving Methodology
===============================

The need for methodology
------------------------

* Structureless thought is inefficient
* Programming is not magic.
	+ Programmers are not magicians - they are masters of structured thought
* Problem solving should not be luck based
* Inspiration is just a consequence of asking the right questions
	+ Inspiration can be practice and trained
	
"Programming isn't for everyone"
--------------------------------

* The only time this phrase is acceptable is if someone finds programming uninteresting.
* Programmers are not among "the chosen few"
* "Programming isn't for everyone" is similar to the following falsehoods
	+ math isn't for everyone
	+ art isn't for everyone
* Skill is influenced more by efficient use of time and effort as opposed to raw talent
* Practice does not make perfect: Perfect practice makes perfect.

The Problem Solving Methodology
-------------------------------

1. **DESCRIBE** the problem
2. **DEFINE** what it means for the problem to be solved
3. **EXPLORE** the problem
4. **CREATE** a solution
5. **EVALUATE** the solution


Problem solving strategies
--------------------------

1. Ask questions
	* What is the problem?
	* What information do we have to work with?
	* When do we know when the problem is solved?
	* What could make the problem hard to solve?
	* Does the problem have similarities with a previously solved problem?
2. Model a plan
	* Diagrams
	* Pictures
	* Patterns
3. Decompose the problem into a sequence of subproblems

Problem solving verification
----------------------------

* Explain the purpose behind each line of code
* Use unit tests to demonstrate correctness
* Generate alternative solutions to the problem
* Evaluate the potential solutions and justify your choice

Debugging Methodology
---------------------

1. Describe the error in **its most primitive form**
2. Identify what specific statements in the source initiated the error
3. Apply the error to the identified source and observe the results
4. List all possible scenarios which result in what was observed
5. Eliminate scenarios from the list that do not apply to this error
