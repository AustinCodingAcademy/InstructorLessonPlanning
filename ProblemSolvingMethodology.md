ACA Problem Solving Methodology
===============================

The need for methodology
------------------------

* Structureless thought is inefficient
* Programming is not magic.
	+ Programmers are not magicians - they are masters of structured thought
* Problem solving should not be luck based
* Inspiration is just a consequence of asking the right questions
	+ Inspiration can be practice and trained
	
"Programming isn't for everyone"
--------------------------------

* The only time this phrase is acceptable is if someone finds programming uninteresting.
* Programmers are not among "the chosen few"
* "Programming isn't for everyone" is similar to the following falsehoods
	+ math isn't for everyone
	+ art isn't for everyone
* Skill is influenced more by time, effort, and experience as opposed to raw talent

The Problem Solving Methodology
-------------------------------

1. Ask questions
	* What is the problem?
	* When do we know when the problem is solved?
	* What could make the problem hard to solve?
	* Does the problem have similarities with a previously solved problem?
2. Create objectives that address the questions
3. Model a plan
	* Diagrams
	* Pictures
	* Patterns
4. Iteratively solve each objective until a solution has been created
5. Justify the solution
	* Explain the purpose behind each line of code
	* Use unit tests to demonstrate correctness
	* Generate alternative solutions to the problem
	* Evaluate the potential solutions and justify your choice
