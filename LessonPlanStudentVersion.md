# 5E Model Lesson Plan – Lofton and Joe
 
* **Objective:** Students will use variables to represent values.
* **Prereading:** Students will read about variables and values from the following specific articles and make detailed notes of each article.
They will save these notes in a folder entitled “ACABackEndIntro” named “Variables_8_16_2015.txt”

* http://www.tutorialspoint.com/php/php_variable_types.htm 
* http://www.tizag.com/phpT/echo.php 
* http://php.net/manual/en/language.variables.basics.php (Up to “User Contributed Notes”)
* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/505642/escape-html-to-php-or-use-echo-which-is-better
* http://thedailywtf.com/articles/Confessions-The-Phone-Number 


## Instructional Plan

### Engage
 
*Slideshow about values

### Explore

* Show a webpage- Which values do you see? / Can we classify them in any way?
    + https://twitter.com/ 
    + https://twitter.com/settings/account



* What if I wanted to change my name on my twitter, how many different times would I have to rewrite it?

### Explain

* What if I wanted to change my name on my twitter, how many different times would I have to rewrite it?

* What is a variable?

**Exercise** Look up http://php.net/manual/en/language.variables.basics.php.  Define 3 variables that represent strings and 3 variables that represent integers based on the info you find on the website. (10 min)

Use phpfiddle.org and click code space on top left

**Exercise**: A local pizza joint, East Side Pies, has hired you to create an online ordering system for their store. Use your personal experiences with ordering food online to determine what variables would be required to fulfill the customer’s order. Assign example values to the variables to demonstrate how you intend the variables to be used.
(20 min)


### Elaborate

Select "run" code on codefiddle. What happens? Why?

Figure out a way to make it show up.

**Exercise:** Make "I love learning PHP!" show up on a webpage using 2 different approaches. 

**Class Discussion**

*How are these 2 approaches different? How are the same?

*What are the benefits of hardcoding vs. using variables?

**Exercise:**

* Create 3 variables that store integers. Use `echo` to make them show up on the webpage.
* Create 3 variables that store floats. Use `echo` to make them show up on the webpage.
* Create 3 variables that store strings. Use `echo` to make them show up on the webpage.
* Create 3 variables that store booleans.

**Note**: Can’t echo out boolean variables.

**Discussion**

* Why do you think PHP requires strings to be surrounded in quotes?
* Why do you think integers and floating points are split into separate
types instead of just having a single “number” type?

**Exercise**

For each question below, store your answer to the question in an appropriately named variable:

1. What is your favorite color?
2. Who is your favorite band or musical artist?
3. Which year were you born?
4. Do you listen to Led Zeppelin once a week?
5. Do you follow Kim Kardashian on instagram?
6. What is your phone number?
7. What is your favorite drink? We might bring it to you if you do good enough in class? (probably not - don’t expect it)
8. What is the number portion of your street address?
9. What is your favorite number?
10. What is the product of 1,234 and 845?
11. If you have $500 in your bank account and a deposit of $750 is made, how much is now in your bank account? (Include currency in your answer)

Echo out your answers by running your code on code fittle. Copy the restuls and email it to me at clofton@austincodingacademy.com.


* Numbers vs numeric strings
    + phone numbers
    + credit card numbers
    + Story of Dallas friend by Joe

### Evaluate

Define a set of variable with values in the form of strings, integers, and floats. Copy the story in your code and then echo the variable inside of the story below. 


Jack and Jill went up the $noun1. They would have driven their $noun2, but it cost $dollaramount1,
so they could not afford it. The temperature was $temp degrees, so they were very $adjective1.
In fact, they were so $adjective1 that they decided not to climb the $noun3 and instead
spent $dollaramount2 dollars on a $noun4 and used it to $verb1. Jack and Jill lived $adv1 ever after.


Important Vocabulary:

* Strings
* Integers
* Variables


**Homework**

Students will read about operators:

* http://www.tizag.com/phpT/operators.php
* http://www.hackingwithphp.com/3/12/3/complete-operator-list (Skip Bitwise Operators)
* http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_operators.asp (Skip Array Operators)


### Exercise 1

1. Save each letter of the alphabet into a variable (ex. `$alpha1 = "a"`, `$alpha2 = "b"`, etc.)
2. Use the variables created in step 1 to display the alphabet in order in the browser.
3. Use the variables created in step 1 to display the alphabet in the browser in reverse order.
4. Assign your name to a variable and use the variable to display your name in the browser.

### Exercise 2

1. Save all the multiples of 8 into variables (ex. `$multiple1 = 8`, `$multiple2 = 16`, etc.) up to 96.
2. Display all the multiples of 8. 
3. Display every other multiple of 8.

### Exercise 3

1. Read about concatenation: 
2. Use it to join strings/integers - add a few examples here

### Exercise 4

Create a glossary to keep track of all the academic vocabulary we learn.

1. Create a new file on your computer called “ACA”.
2. Create a new document and save it as “Glossary”.
3. Add these words to your glossary:
    * Strings
    * Integers
    * Variables
    
Find definitions for each of the words. Include coding examples.
